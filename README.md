## ✨ Key Features

* **[Feature 1]**: 🔓 Decoupled Update Loop (Unlocked FPS): This feature separates the visual rendering loop from the server's logic loop. Even if the internal server experiences a slowdown (drop in TPS), the game remains visually smooth, often exceeding 144 FPS.
* **[Feature 2]**: 🧠 D.A.B. (Dynamic Activation of Brains): An AI optimization system that analyzes the distance of entities in real time. Entities that are close maintain their normal behavior, while those located more than 32 blocks away enter a "sleep" mode to reduce CPU load by up to 80%.
* **[Feature 3]**: ⏳ Time Dilation: Instead of crashing the game during massive calculations (like TNT explosions), the engine slows down the simulation in "Slow Motion" mode. This allows the processor to catch up without ever freezing the screen or crashing the client.
